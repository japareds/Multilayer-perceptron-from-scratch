# Multilayer perceptron from scratch

I built it to understand and consult how the algorithm works. In practice I will not use this.
Training done using THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

Written in Octave/MatLab for simplicity handling matrices.
Needs a [n x m] input matrix where n is the feature vector for m examples.
MLP.m is the main file.

Model validation techniques are not handled by the scripts
# To do:
- receive the number of hidden layers from input without explicitly adding a variable for the new weight matrix
- Build a confusion matrix
